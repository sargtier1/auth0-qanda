#Auth0 full stack react application.

- express server
- Vanilla react front-end
- Auth0 using auth0-js class approach.

This was a case study for understanding auth0. My other repo `<a href="https://github.com/sargtier1/videoGameApp" target='_blank'>videoGameApp</a>` was the successor to this case study, and uses a similar approach with Gatsby.js. Note however, Data will not persist in this app (Q & App) due to an array acting as database.
